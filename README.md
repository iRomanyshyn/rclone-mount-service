# Rclone mount systemd service installation script
Of course, it was not my idea but someone needs to get the thing done till the final "product". I hate to manually create the systemd service for mounting every Rclone remote, so I made the installation script to automate this routine. As I hate bash scripts, I have utilized the OpenAI ChatGPT and Claude to do the job but those services are still pretty dumb, so I had a lot of frustration when it added something and ruined other things.

**Please, share any thoughts on making this script better! Especially in the part of remotes names handling, a proper mount options for any remote (as I want to make a "universal" systemd unit file).**
